 AdventOfCode
Code for advent of code.

This is part of an event proposing 1 coding challenge a day to help Santa get back the keys of the sleigh
 before christmas. (He inadvertantly droped those in the ocean)

All code was done independently in python and no external library was used. (except numpy for some basic operations and cleaner prints for matrixes)

The code is not optimized to the maximum, the logical aspect of the problem is the interesting point and
as long as the solution runs in less than 2s or so I am satisfied.
